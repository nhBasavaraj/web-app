### 3. Library Installation Issue with llm-agent
- **Status:** Resolved ‚úÖ
- **Description:**
  - llm-agent can't install any libraries during QnA process.
  - Before running or using the app, it's recommended to install all required libraries and tools mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
- **Example:**
  - If a required library like matplotlib is not installed, and the agent is asked to plot a chart, it will try to import the library. If the import fails, it will attempt to install the library. However, since the agent can't install libraries, this process will fail continuously until the agent stops due to iteration or time limit.
